Android App:
This is a splash screen with an animation. After some time, this screen will change to another page. I spent lots of time just to make it full screen. After closing the app and the text needs to change to "Hello!". I am working on it currently.
Update: I did the splash screen. If the app opens first time text is "Welcome!", other times the text is "Helllo!". After some time, the screen goes to next page automatically. I did horizontal scrollview with buttons. I fetched text of the buttons from API. If the button is clicked it will be highlighted. From now on, I will work on vertical scrollview and fetching from api.
Update:I did gridview with fetching images and names from api. I did the color change when button is clicked. Now, i will work on data fetching according to the location.
Update: Now, I realised that I needeed to fetch data from location database into gridview, not from characters . Because I have to get all characters URLs from location database, then fetch name and image from this URLs. I did the correct way. Now, i need to get the button's variable when i click them. Then i will put it inside url.
